# Hello there 

I wanted to let you know that these 👉 ``````` are called "back-ticks" 

and when I put one on either side of the charactars I am typing it looks like this: `boop-a-doop!`

I will be using those to show you what it looks like before and after, or rather in code and then rendered.

We will start with fonts

<br>


> *italicized* 

`*Bubbles*`

*Bubbles*

<br>

> **bold**

`**Bubbles**`

**Bubbles**

<br>

> ***Bold and italicized***

`***Bubbles***`

***Bubbles***

## Next > Headings


Just like in HTML there are different ways to express headings H1, H2, H3 . . . 

In Markdown syntax this looks like this 


`# Heading`

`## Heading`

`### Heading`

`#### Heading`

`##### Heading`

`###### Heading`


# Heading
## Heading
### Heading
#### Heading
##### Heading
###### Heading

<br>

This is how this might be used...


````
###✍🏾 Journaling

Dear Diary today I did some things....
````


looks like: 


### ✍🏾 Journaling

Dear Diary today I did some things....

> Something to notice about headings is that `#` and `##` both will render solid lines underneath of them when used. 

# example `#`
## example `##`
### example `###`

<br>

## Comments 
> this is a comment

`> this is how you make a comment`

<br>

## On bullets

`+`

`-`

`+ bullet`

+ bullet

and then you can indent them

````
+ one
  + two (two spaces creates the first indent)
    + three (four spaces to make this indent, keep adding two spaces, each space matters!) ....   
````

+ one
  + two (two spaces creates the first indent)
    + three (four spaces to make this indent, keep adding two spaces, each space matters!) ....
